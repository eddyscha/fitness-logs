# Fitness Logs

A personal record of my fitness logs for visualisation, analysis, and sharing with coaches. Currently a long-term WIP :) 

## Development Environment

You can build and run this app with all its dependencies with VSCode and the remote-containers extension. Everything is Dockerized! 

## Backend

A simple Flask API and PostgreSQL service using sqlalchemy as an ORM.
